# Blog Series Repository: Hypha - Neural Network Fundamentals

Welcome to the repository for our [blog series](https://romankyrkalo.hashnode.dev/the-neural-symphony-understanding-forward-propagation-in-ai) on Neural Network Fundamentals!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a companion to our educational blog series on neural networks. Through this series, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying neural networks, their architecture, training processes, and applications.

## About the Blog Series

In this blog series, we will cover a range of topics, including:
- Introduction to neural networks
- Basics of feedforward neural networks
- Activation functions and their role
- Training neural networks: Backpropagation and optimization
- Understanding and implementing hidden layers
- Application of neural networks in various domains
- Advanced topics: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), etc.

Each blog post will delve into a specific aspect of neural networks, providing clear explanations, code examples, and practical insights to aid your understanding.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **Code Examples**: Contains code snippets, scripts, and notebooks referenced in the blog posts.
